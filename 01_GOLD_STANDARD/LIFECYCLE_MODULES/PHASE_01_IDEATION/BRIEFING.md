# PHASE 01: IDEATION
## Briefing Document

**Phase Number:** 1
**Phase Name:** Ideation
**Purpose:** Capture the initial spark of an idea

---

## WHAT THIS PHASE IS

Ideation is the genesis of every project. It's where the first spark of an idea is captured, articulated, and recorded. This is not about refinement or feasibility - it's about capturing the essence of what you want to create.

**Key Insight:** Ideas in your head are useless. Ideas on paper (or in a document) can be evaluated, refined, shared, and built.

---

## WHAT YOU'RE DOING

1. **Articulating the core idea** in plain language
2. **Identifying the problem** being solved
3. **Describing the desired outcome** at a high level
4. **Noting any initial constraints** or considerations

---

## WHAT YOU'RE NOT DOING

- Evaluating feasibility (that's Phase 2)
- Defining requirements (that's Phase 3)
- Designing solutions (that's Phase 4+)
- Judging whether it's "good enough"

**The only failure in Phase 1 is not capturing the idea at all.**

## DELIVERABLES

| Deliverable | Format | Length |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Idea Statement | Paragraph | 2-4 sentences |
| Problem Statement | Paragraph | 2-3 sentences |
| Success Vision | Paragraph | 2-3 sentences |
| Initial Constraints | Bullet list | As needed |

## IDEA STATEMENT TEMPLATE

```markdown
## Idea Statement

I want to build [WHAT] that [DOES WHAT] for [WHOM].

The core value is [VALUE].
```

**Example:**
> I want to build a signal aggregation platform that organizes trading chart data for traders. The core value is providing organized information without interpretation.

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT TEMPLATE

```markdown
## Problem Statement

Currently, [SITUATION].
This is a problem because [CONSEQUENCE].
```

**Example:**
> Currently, traders have to manually check multiple chart sources and mentally track signal states. This is a problem because it's time-consuming and error-prone.

---

## SUCCESS VISION TEMPLATE

```markdown
## Success Vision

When this is complete, [USER] will be able to [DO WHAT].
They will no longer have to [OLD WAY].
```

**Example:**
> When this is complete, traders will be able to see all their signals in one organized dashboard. They will no longer have to manually track each chart individually.

---

## QUALITY CHECK

Before leaving Phase 1, ask:

1. **Can someone else understand the idea from reading this?**
   - If no, clarify further

2. **Is the problem clear?**
   - If no, articulate the pain point

3. **Is the success vision tangible?**
   - If no, make it more concrete

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

### 1. Too Vague
**Problem:** "I want to make something to help people"
**Fix:** Be specific about what, who, and how

### 2. Too Detailed
**Problem:** 10-page document with technical specifications
**Fix:** Save details for later phases; keep Phase 1 simple

### 3. Solution Before Problem
**Problem:** "I want to use React and PostgreSQL to build..."
**Fix:** Technology choices come later; focus on what and why

### 4. Not Capturing It
**Problem:** "I have a great idea in my head"
**Fix:** Write it down NOW, even if imperfect

---

## EXIT CRITERIA

Phase 1 is complete when:

- [ ] Idea is written down
- [ ] Problem is articulated
- [ ] Success vision is described
- [ ] Principal confirms: "This is what I want to explore"

---

## NEXT STEPS

After completing this phase:
1. Review output with fresh eyes
2. Confirm this captures the intent
3. Proceed to Phase 2: Concept Crystallization
4. Load `LIFECYCLE_MODULES/PHASE_02_CONCEPT/`
