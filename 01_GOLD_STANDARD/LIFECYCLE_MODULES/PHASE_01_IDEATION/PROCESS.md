# PHASE 01: IDEATION
## Process Document

**Phase Number:** 1
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for capturing ideas

## THE IDEATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Capture the Raw Idea (5-10 minutes)

**Action:** Write down the idea without filtering or judging.

**Prompt questions:**
- What do you want to create?
- What sparked this idea?
- What would it do?
- Who would use it?

**Output:** Raw idea notes (messy is fine)

---

### Step 2: Identify the Problem (5-10 minutes)

**Action:** Clarify what problem this solves.

**Prompt questions:**
- What frustration does this address?
- What's the current situation?
- Why is that situation bad?
- What happens if this problem isn't solved?

**Output:** Problem statement

---

### Step 3: Envision Success (5-10 minutes)

**Action:** Describe what success looks like.

**Prompt questions:**
- When this is done, what will be different?
- What will users be able to do?
- What will they no longer have to do?
- How will they feel?

**Output:** Success vision

---

### Step 4: Note Constraints (5 minutes)

**Action:** Record any known constraints.

**Consider:**
- Time constraints (deadlines?)
- Budget constraints (cost limits?)
- Technical constraints (platform, language?)
- Regulatory constraints (compliance?)
- Resource constraints (team size?)

**Output:** Constraint list (may be empty)

---

### Step 5: Synthesize (5-10 minutes)

**Action:** Combine into the standard format.

```markdown
# Idea: [Name]

## Idea Statement
[One paragraph describing what you want to build]

## Problem Statement
[One paragraph describing the problem being solved]

## Success Vision
[One paragraph describing what success looks like]

## Initial Constraints
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
- [...]

## Date
[Today's date]

## Status
Ready for Phase 2: Concept Crystallization
```

---

### Step 6: Verify (2 minutes)

**Action:** Quick sanity check.

- [ ] Can I explain this idea to someone in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is the problem clear?
- [ ] Is the success vision tangible?
- [ ] Have I captured what's in my head?

If all YES → Phase 1 complete
If any NO → Refine that section

## TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE IDEATION

### 1. Time-Box It
Don't spend hours perfecting. 30-45 minutes is enough for Phase 1.

### 2. Don't Self-Censor
Capture the idea even if it seems "too big" or "too simple."

### 3. Write for Someone Else
Pretend someone else will read this with no context.

### 4. Separate Idea from Solution
"I want to help traders see signals" ≠ "I want to build a React dashboard"

### 5. One Idea Per Document
Don't mix multiple ideas. Create separate documents.

## IDEATION SESSION FORMAT

For formal ideation sessions:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Setup, clear mind |
| 0:05-0:15 | Raw idea capture |
| 0:15-0:25 | Problem identification |
| 0:25-0:35 | Success visioning |
| 0:35-0:40 | Constraint noting |
| 0:40-0:45 | Synthesis |

---

## HANDLING MULTIPLE IDEAS

If multiple ideas emerge:

1. Capture ALL of them briefly
2. Select ONE to develop fully in this session
3. Store others in "Idea Backlog"
4. Each idea gets its own lifecycle
