## STEP 1: GATHER INPUT

### 1.1 Collect Raw Materials

From Phase 1 (Ideation):
- [ ] Idea documentation received
- [ ] Initial problem statements reviewed
- [ ] Stakeholder notes gathered
- [ ] Context information compiled

### 1.2 Identify Knowledge Gaps

Ask these questions:
- What don't we know yet?
- Who else needs to provide input?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What constraints exist?

### 1.3 Conduct Discovery Sessions

```markdown
## Discovery Session Record

**Date:** [Date]
**Participants:** [List]
**Duration:** [Time]

### Topics Covered
1. [Topic 1]
2. [Topic 2]

### Key Insights
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

### Open Questions
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

### Action Items
- [ ] [Action 1] - Owner: [Name]
- [ ] [Action 2] - Owner: [Name]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEFINE SCOPE

### 2.1 Problem Definition

Write a clear problem statement:

```markdown
## Problem Statement

**Current State:** [What exists today]

**Pain Points:**
1. [Pain point 1]
2. [Pain point 2]

**Desired State:** [What we want to achieve]

**Gap:** [The difference between current and desired]
```

### 2.2 Scope Boundaries

Define what's IN and OUT:

```markdown
## Scope Definition

### IN SCOPE
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]
- [Item 3]

### OUT OF SCOPE
- [Item 1] - Reason: [Why excluded]
- [Item 2] - Reason: [Why excluded]

### DEFERRED (Future Phases)
- [Item 1] - Target: [When to address]
- [Item 2] - Target: [When to address]
```

### 2.3 Constraint Identification

Document all constraints:

| Constraint Type | Description | Impact | Flexibility |
|----------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Budget | [Amount] | [Impact] | Fixed/Flexible |
| Timeline | [Deadline] | [Impact] | Fixed/Flexible |
| Technology | [Limitation] | [Impact] | Fixed/Flexible |
| Resources | [Limitation] | [Impact] | Fixed/Flexible |
| Regulatory | [Requirement] | [Impact] | Fixed |

---

## STEP 3: VALIDATE CONCEPT

### 3.1 Stakeholder Validation

Present concept to stakeholders:

```markdown
## Stakeholder Validation Record

**Stakeholder:** [Name/Role]
**Date:** [Date]

### Concept Presented
[Brief summary of concept]

### Feedback Received
- [Feedback 1]
- [Feedback 2]

### Concerns Raised
- [Concern 1] - Resolution: [How addressed]
- [Concern 2] - Resolution: [How addressed]

### Approval Status
[ ] Approved
[ ] Approved with changes
[ ] Rejected - Reason: [Why]
```

### 3.2 Technical Feasibility

Assess technical viability:

- [ ] Technology stack can support concept
- [ ] Required integrations are possible
- [ ] Performance requirements achievable
- [ ] Security requirements addressable
- [ ] No fundamental technical blockers

### 3.3 Business Viability

Assess business case:

- [ ] Value proposition is clear
- [ ] Cost/benefit is favorable
- [ ] Timeline is realistic
- [ ] Resources are available
- [ ] Risks are acceptable

## STEP 4: DOCUMENT OUTPUT

### 4.1 Create Concept Document

```markdown
# Concept Document: [Project Name]

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [Date]
**Author:** [Name]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph summary]

## Problem Statement
[From Step 2.1]

## Proposed Solution
[High-level description of solution concept]

## Scope
[From Step 2.2]

## Constraints
[From Step 2.3]

## Success Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Mitigation] |

## Stakeholder Sign-off
| Stakeholder | Role | Date | Signature |
|-------------|------|------|-----------|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Date] | _________ |

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 3: Requirements Analysis
2. [Additional next steps]
```

### 4.2 Record Decisions

Document all decisions made:

```markdown
## Decision Record: DEC-[NUMBER]

**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Date:** [Date]
**Decision Maker:** [Name/Role]

**Context:**
[Why this decision was needed]

**Options Considered:**
1. [Option 1] - Pros: [X] Cons: [Y]
2. [Option 2] - Pros: [X] Cons: [Y]

**Rationale:**
[Why this option was chosen]

**Implications:**
[What this decision affects]
```

## QUALITY CHECKS

Before completing Phase 2:

- [ ] Problem statement is clear and agreed
- [ ] Scope boundaries are defined
- [ ] Constraints are documented
- [ ] Stakeholders have validated concept
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Business viability confirmed
- [ ] Concept document complete
- [ ] Decisions recorded
- [ ] Exit criteria checklist passed

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Scope creep | Define clear boundaries early |
| Vague problem statement | Use specific, measurable language |
| Missing stakeholder input | Identify all stakeholders upfront |
| Undocumented decisions | Record decisions as they're made |
| Assumed constraints | Validate all constraints explicitly |
