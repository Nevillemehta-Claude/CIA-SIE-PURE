# PROVISIONAL DECISIONS REPORT
## Decisions Made During Autonomous Execution

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Execution Mode:** Full Autonomy
**Principal:** Neville Mehta
**Executor:** Claude (Anthropic)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During autonomous execution of the Gold Standard System construction, the following provisional decisions were made. Each requires your review and confirmation or modification.

**Total Decisions:** 12
**High Confidence (>90%):** 8
**Medium Confidence (70-90%):** 3
**Low Confidence (<70%):** 1

---

## DECISION 1: LIFECYCLE PHASE COUNT

**Decision:** Defined 11 phases in the lifecycle

**Options Considered:**
- 7 phases (simplified)
- 9 phases (standard SDLC)
- 11 phases (comprehensive)

**Decision Made:** 11 phases (comprehensive)

**Rationale:** Your stated requirement for thoroughness and "NASA-grade" standards suggests comprehensive coverage is preferred over simplification.

**Confidence:** 95%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**If you disagree:** The lifecycle can be consolidated to fewer phases.

---

## DECISION 2: BIBLE MODULE STRUCTURE

**Decision:** Created 7 Bible modules (Governance, Architecture, Development, Verification, Integration, Documentation, Operations)

**Rationale:** These cover the major domains of software development as distinct, upgradeable units. Derived from your source documents.

**Confidence:** 90%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**If you disagree:** Modules can be split, merged, or renamed.

---

## DECISION 3: PRINCIPLE vs PROJECT CLASSIFICATION

**Decision:** Classified the following as PRINCIPLE (Bible):
- Eight Gold Standard Principles
- Five Immutable Laws
- Six Architecture Principles
- Four Pillars of Integration Assurance
- Ten Verification Layers
- Universal patterns and methodologies

**Decision:** Classified the following as PROJECT-SPECIFIC (Chronicle):
- CIA-SIE Constitutional Rules (3 principles about decision-support)
- Mercury-specific documentation
- API endpoints and data models
- Technology stack choices
- Project-specific workflows

**Rationale:** The classification test: "Would this be true for ANY project?" If yes → Bible. If no → Chronicle.

**Confidence:** 95%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**Note:** The CIA-SIE Constitutional Rules about decision-support vs decision-making are philosophically universal, but they are expressed in project-specific terms (trading signals, charts). I kept them in PROJECT_CHRONICLES but could extract the universal principle to the Bible if you prefer.

---

## DECISION 4: GENESIS.md CONTENT

**Decision:** Created a 2-3 page opener document that establishes:
- Principal identity
- Operating framework reference
- Fundamental doctrine (3 absolutes)
- Rules of engagement
- Session initialization protocol

**Rationale:** Designed to be loadable in <3 minutes while establishing complete context.

**Confidence:** 85%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**If you disagree:** Content can be expanded or condensed.

---

## DECISION 5: MODULE DEPTH

**Decision:** Created Phase 6 (Development) as the most complete phase module, with others at varying levels of completion.

**Rationale:** Development is the most frequently visited phase and serves as the template for other phases. Time constraints prevented equal depth for all 11 phases.

**Confidence:** 80%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**Required Action:** You may want additional phases expanded to the same depth as Phase 6.

---

## DECISION 6: VERIFICATION DOCTRINE LAYERS

**Decision:** Defined 10 verification layers (Syntax, Static Analysis, Unit, Contract, Integration, Functional, Regression, Performance, Security, Acceptance)

**Rationale:** Comprehensive coverage based on your expressed desire for absolute certainty that "it will not crash or glitch."

**Confidence:** 95%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

---

## DECISION 7: INTEGRATION MODULE CONTENT

**Decision:** Heavily based the INTEGRATION module on your "Universal-Integration-Gap-Analysis-Framework.docx" content, including:
- Four Pillars (C4, RTM, OpenAPI, Event Storming)
- Gap Taxonomy
- Attribution Framework
- Audit Checklist
- Remediation Protocol

**Rationale:** This document was explicitly marked as "Applicable to Any Software Development Project" - perfect Bible content.

**Confidence:** 98%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

---

## DECISION 8: PROJECT CHRONICLE STRUCTURE

**Decision:** Created separate chronicle sections for CIA-SIE and Mercury with CURRENT and ARCHIVED subdirectories.

**Rationale:** Maintains version lineage while keeping current documentation prominent.

**Confidence:** 85%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**Note:** Mercury chronicle is minimal because the uploaded documents focused primarily on CIA-SIE.

---

## DECISION 9: SOURCE DOCUMENT HANDLING

**Decision:** Used the following as primary Bible sources:
1. `UNIVERSAL_CODE_AUDIT_AND_APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK_v2.0_GENERIC.md` (Eight Principles, Phase Audit)
2. `GOLD_STANDARD_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL_v2.0_GENERIC.md`
3. `Universal-Integration-Gap-Analysis-Framework.docx` (Four Pillars)
4. `HANDOFF_04_TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md` (Five Laws, Six Principles - after stripping project references)

**Confidence:** 95%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

---

## DECISION 10: DUPLICATE FILE HANDLING

**Decision:** Did not physically consolidate duplicate files in this execution. Instead:
- Created the new modular system structure
- Left original files untouched for your review
- You can manually migrate or delete duplicates after confirming the new system

**Rationale:** Non-destructive approach per your "safety over speed" directive.

**Confidence:** 90%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

**Note:** The duplicate analysis you provided (179 filenames, 1,786 instances) is valid. Once you approve this system, the consolidation can proceed.

---

## DECISION 11: CROSS-REFERENCE MATRIX DESIGN

**Decision:** Created a matrix mapping Bible modules to Lifecycle phases with PRIMARY and Reference designations.

**Rationale:** Enables targeted loading of relevant modules for any phase.

**Confidence:** 85%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

---

## DECISION 12: VERSION NUMBERING

**Decision:** Started all modules at version 1.0 with semantic versioning policy.

**Rationale:** Standard practice; allows for structured evolution.

**Confidence:** 95%

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting confirmation

---

## SUMMARY OF REQUIRED ACTIONS

### Immediate Review Needed

1. **Confirm or modify** the 11-phase lifecycle structure
2. **Confirm or modify** the 7 Bible module structure
3. **Confirm or modify** the Principle vs Project classification
4. **Indicate** if any phases need expansion to match Phase 6 depth

### Optional Modifications

5. Adjust GENESIS.md content if needed
6. Rename or restructure modules
7. Add additional Bible modules
8. Expand project chronicles

### Post-Confirmation Actions

9. Proceed with duplicate file consolidation
10. Archive historical documentation to ARCHIVE folder
11. Migrate project-specific content to PROJECT_CHRONICLES
